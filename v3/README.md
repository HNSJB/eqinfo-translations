# EQInfo 3.x

Translation files are given as [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/) `.ts` files.
Each file is called `eqinfo_{lang}.ts`. Qt5 provides a tool called Linguist.
If you have Qt5 installed already on your system you can launch it with
`linguist`, open a translation file and edit it. We also provide a small
[web application](https://demo.gempa.de/linguist) which can be used as an
alternative without any additional software installation.

There are two options to contribute your translation:

1. Fork this repository and create a pull request.
2. Send your translation file to android-dev (at) gempa.de and we will
   merge it into the code base.
